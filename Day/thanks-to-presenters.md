Thank to everybody for presenting to Eclipse Day China
It was first time, and it was rough at edges and even failed in some moments.

Please make sure that your presentation is present on 
http://eclipse-china.github.io/Day/
and that your presentation has your contacts at some slide.
People who really interested will contact you.

Big thanks to LiuYang for leading Track 2
(we had technical issues setting WebEx/Skype and had our lunch as sandwiches in office)
The only way to grow big in China is to have Chinese friends.
 Jack Liu is contributing to VJET and has did unexpectedly great presentation. Also Andreas Graf stroke everyone with Chinese knowledge.
Hope next session there will be more Chinese also covering yours or related topics. I also think to do the Day shorter with more tracks. We learned a lot how to make it better.

IMPORTANT: I invite all to do in again as November Day. This time we should have agenda fixed 2-4 weeks before. And details having presenters photo, bio, link etc. (Good advise for templates )
