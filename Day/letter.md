We had 200 registrations, but only 42 guests. (Too many trolls)
But a lot of people have contacted me afterwards asking about.

Eileen from Actuate said she would go for November Day
but now there is big boss there in Shanghai, so thing can turn much worse or much better.
Wait end of week for final valuation by our bosses.

I will go anyway as DemoCamp. Hopefully this time more Eclipse members will support.
We had IBM & Rad Hat guys
If Actuate will go again, than I hope that we do both in Beijing & Shanghai
and share remote sessions. 
In this case, you can come to any city you like. But a bit more preparation is needed.

We already decided that we should have agenda fixed 1 month before the event.

Preliminary it is November 29th Saturday, but Actuate said they may be busy in November, so we may shift 2 weeks afterwards. Any way I already invite speakers, but this time more official:
please give
- topic
- abstract
- your short bio
- photo
- some links about
- how to advertise your session (e.g. new feature release)

Would be nice to see SpringSource company support also.
