### Call for support

Eclipse Day China is 2 weeks away. We have venue, 99 registered, 22 presenters, 5 organizers and 2 volunteers... But no sponsors (except for Eclipse itself).

[See Sponsors section in Eclipse wiki](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Day_China#Sponsors_.E8.B5.9E.E5.8A.A9)

*This is call for support!* 

Half of Eclipse members are in China or have big Chinese clients. Please support Chinese Eclipse event as you do elsewhere.

There is no minimum requirement. 
We don't really need much money (only snacks, best presenter & topics awards, maybe some lucky draw for 50$ present, etc)
Help as much as you can. **The most important is that you show support for Eclipse.**

We still have 2-3 presentation slots left. Welcome if you have something to say to Eclipse Community in China!
