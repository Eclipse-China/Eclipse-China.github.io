Decided
- no weibo for registration
- fee for unregistered
- advertise presenters and event content (before and during event)
- fix agenda 1 month before
- have enough time to train track leaders
- shorter duration (with more tracks if more sessions)

Not decided:
- how to treat trolls
- next event pricing (*1)

New ideas:
- printed agenda or agenda quickly available (like special mobile app)
- escalating price principle (*1)

Learned:
- 1 registration 1 ticket 

(*1)
Imagine we have 200 registered and we want to go for 500
We definitely need to rent venue
200-400 venue price is 8000 and more
That is 40-80 per seat
Do you want to pay for every guest in that case?
Even though they maybe don't have interest in your topic/product.
I mean ticket price should cover venue rent
If we get big sponsor (e.g. for venue), then we already have budget

So would you agree in principle that we should have way to extend to larger numbers and priced ticket
 is the only way when we don't have sponsors and don't want to waste our companies money...
