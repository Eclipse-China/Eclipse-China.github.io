Hello NexB

I am software developer, currently working in China.
I became proponent for Eclipse in my company, then in China (organizing first ever Eclipse Day). I have noticed that EasyEclipse http://www.easyeclipse.org/site/news/index.html is without changes for a long time.
In the same time eclipse.org itself seems to care more about Eclipse developers than developers with Eclipse. I want to set-up site for developers to shawcast Eclipse is easy and great!

Let's give EasyEclipse.org second breath.

Best regards,
Paul Verest
