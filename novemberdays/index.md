## {{ page.title }}

This is preparation page for November Days China (Beijing & ShangHai).  
Planned date is November 23th, Saturday.
我们打算11月30号周六在准备Day活动。和我们一起来吧。给世界演示中国的成功，给大家分享。    
<http://time.is/compare/0900_30_November_2013_in_Beijing/CET/London/New_York/Los_Angeles>

This time is will be shorter, but more tracks (when more speakers),
so hopefully some specialized tracks will be there.  
下一次应该较短的时间,跟多track吧。

Proposed topic tracks are Tools, Architecture (not limited).  
Topics should be Eclipse-related, but as we expect to have 20 and more topics some may be general about software development. 

Although some would like to have Chinese-only or English-only tracks, I think it would be bad practice,
 that would favor laziness not to study other languages. Sessions would be grouped by content not language.  

I hope guest select topics by interest, not by language used.    
希望大家找最有意思的主题，换track，不管用什么语言讲的。
